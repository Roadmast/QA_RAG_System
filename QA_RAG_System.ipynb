Overview\\n\\n# 1.1 Company overview\\n\\nInfosys Limited (\\'the Company\\' or Infosys) provides consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their digital transformation. Infosys strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future.\\n\\nInfosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is hereinafter referred to as \"the Group\".\\n\\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics city, Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\\n\\nThe Group\\'s interim condensed consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the Company\\'s Board of Directors on April 18, 2024.\\n\\n# 1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements\\n\\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in compliance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\\'the Act\\') and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.\\n\\nAccounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.\\n\\nAs the quarter and year-to-date figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the quarter figures in this statement added up to the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-to-date figures reported in this statement.\\n\\n# 1.3 Basis of consolidation\\n\\nInfosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity\\'s returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\\n\\nThe financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain/loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the Company, are excluded.\\n\\n# 1.4 Use of estimates and judgments\\n\\nThe preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note no. 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Revenue recognition\\n\\nThe Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.\\n\\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.\\n\\nThe Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.\\n\\nContracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\\n\\nProvisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\\n\\n# b. Income taxes\\n\\nThe Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.\\n\\nSignificant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions.\\n\\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15).\\n\\n# c. Business combinations and intangible assets\\n\\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Note 2.1).\\n\\n# d. Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note 2.2).\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Impairment of Goodwill\\n\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGUs) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\\n\\nThe recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell.

Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n# 2.1 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\\n\\n# Accounting policy\\n\\nBusiness combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.\\n\\nBusiness combinations between entities under common control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nThe payments related to options issued by the Group over the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognized.\\n\\n# Acquisitions during the year ended March 31, 2023\\n\\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023 the Group, completed two business combinations to complement its digital offerings by acquiring 100% voting interests in:\\n\\n1. oddity GmbH, oddity group services GmbH, oddity space GmbH, oddity jungle GmbH, oddity code GmbH and oddity waves GmbH (collectively known as oddity), a Germany-based digital marketing, experience, and commerce agencies on April 20, 2022.\\n2. BASE life science A/S, a consulting and technology firm in the life Science industry in Europe on September 1, 2022.\\n\\nThese acquisitions are expected to strengthen the Group’s creative, branding and experience design capabilities and augment the Group’s life sciences expertise, scales its digital transformation capabilities with cloud based industry solutions and expand its presence across Europe.\\n\\n# The purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon determination of fair values at the dates of acquisition as follows:\\n\\n|Component|Acquiree's carrying amount|Fair value adjustments|Purchase price allocated|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Net Assets(1)|103|-|103|\\n|Intangible assets :| | | |\\n|Customer contracts and relationships|-|274|274|\\n|Vendor relationships|-|30|30|\\n|Brand|-|24|24|\\n|Deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets|-|(80)|(80)|\\n|Total|103|248|351|\\n|Goodwill|630|630|630|\\n|Total purchase price|981|981|981|\\n\\n(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents acquired of ₹ 26 crore.\\n\\nThe excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which qualify as an intangible asset.\\n\\nGoodwill is not tax-deductible. Goodwill pertaining to these business combinations is allocated to operating segments as more fully described in Note 2.3.1.\\n\\nThe purchase consideration of ₹981 crore includes cash of ₹936 crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of ₹45 crore as on the date of acquisition. At the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination of the fair value of contingent consideration are the probabilities assigned towards achievement of financial targets and discount rate of 12.5%. As of March 31, 2024 the contingent consideration was fully paid.\\n\\nAdditionally, these acquisitions have shareholder and employee retention bonus payable to the employees of the acquiree over three years, subject to their continuous employment with the Group along with achievement of financial targets for the respective years.

Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\\n\\n|Buildings (1)|22-25 years|\\n|---|---|\\n|Plant and machinery (1)(2)|5 years|\\n|Office equipment|5 years|\\n|Computer equipment (1)|3-5 years|\\n|Furniture and fixtures (1)|5 years|\\n|Vehicles(1)|5 years|\\n|Leasehold improvements|Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term|\\n\\n(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.\\n\\n(2) Includes Solar plant with a useful life of 25 years.\\n\\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.\\n\\nAdvances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.\\n\\n# Impairment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets.

When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\\n\\n# Impairment\\n\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.\\n\\n# Following is a summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill:\\n\\n|Particulars|As at March 31, 2024|March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Carrying value at the beginning|7,248|6,195|\\n|Goodwill on acquisitions (Refer to note 2.1)|—|630|\\n|Translation differences|55|423|\\n|Carrying value at the end|7,303|7,248|\\n\\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.\\n\\n# 2.3.2 Intangible Assets\\n\\n# Accounting policy\\n\\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.\\n\\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.\\n\\n# Impairment\\n\\nIntangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.\\n\\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.\\n\\n# 2.10.2 Subsequent measurement\\n\\n# a. Non-derivative financial instruments\\n\\n# (i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost\\n\\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n\\n# (ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\\n\\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.\\n\\n# (iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\\n\\nA financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.\\n\\n# (iv) Financial liabilities\\n\\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration and financial liability under option arrangements recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\n\\n# b. Derivative financial instruments\\n\\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.\\n\\n# (i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss.\\n\\nThis category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges.\\n\\nAlthough the Group believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss.\\n\\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets/ liabilities in this category are presented as current assets/current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\\n\\n# (ii) Cash flow hedge\\n\\nThe Group designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions.\\n\\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\n# 2.10.3 Derecognition of financial instruments\\n\\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\\n\\nRefer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n\\n# 2.10.5 Impairment\\n\\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.\\n\\nThe Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.\\n\\nThe amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\n# Financial instruments by category\\n\\nThe carrying value and fair value of financial instruments by categories as at March 31, 2024 are as follows:\\n\\n|Particulars|Amortized cost|Financial assets/ liabilities at fair value through profit or loss|Financial assets/liabilities at fair value through OCI|Total carrying value|Total fair value|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Assets:| | | | | |\\n|Cash and cash equivalents (Refer to Note 2.8)|14,786|—|—|—|14,786|\\n|Investments (Refer to Note 2.4)| | | | | |\\n|Equity and preference securities|—|—|—|206|206|\\n|Tax free bonds and government bonds|1,759|—|—|1,759|1,973 (1)|\\n|Liquid mutual fund units|—|—|2,615|—|2,615|\\n|Target maturity fund units|—|—|431|—|431|\\n|Non convertible debentures|—|—|—|4,179|4,179|\\n|Government securities|—|—|—|7,362|7,362|\\n|Commercial papers|—|—|—|4,830|4,830|\\n|Certificates of deposit|—|—|—|3,043|3,043|\\n|Other investments|—|—|198|—|198|\\n|Trade receivables (Refer to Note 2.7)|30,193|—|—|30,193|30,193|\\n|Loans (Refer to Note 2.5)|282|—|—|282|282|\\n|Other financials assets (Refer to Note 2.6) (3)|15,106|—|61|—|15,190|\\n|Total|62,126|—|3,305|19,437|85,074|\\n|Liabilities:| | | | | |\\n|Trade payables|3,956|—|—|3,956|3,956|\\n|Lease liabilities (Refer to Note 2.19)|8,359|—|—|8,359|8,359|\\n|Financial Liability under option arrangements (Refer to Note 2.12)|—|—|597|—|597|\\n|Other financial liabilities (Refer to Note 2.12)|15,750|—|30|15,781|15,781|\\n|Total|28,065|—|627|28,693|28,693|\\n\\n(1) On account of fair value changes including interest accrued\\n\\n(2) Excludes interest accrued on tax free bonds and government bonds carried at amortized cost of ₹84 crore\\n\\n(3) Excludes unbilled revenue on contracts where the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.\\n\\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nThe Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹937 crore and ₹106 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.\\n\\nDuring the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the Company received orders under sections 250 and 254 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹ 1,628 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.\\n\\nDeferred income tax for three months and year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 substantially relates to origination and reversal of temporary differences.\\n\\nThe Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021.

Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.\\n\\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\\n\\nThe Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.\\n\\nThe Group’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\\n\\nRevenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\\n\\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based billing and / or milestone based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).\\n\\nIn arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.\\n\\nCertain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.\\n\\nRevenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.\\n\\nArrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the services are rendered.\\n\\nContracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\\n\\nA contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust (the Trust). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.\\n\\nThe Group operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These plans are managed by third party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and/or for a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that varies depending on the age of the respective employees.\\n\\nLiabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market risk.\\n\\nThe Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\n# Provident fund\\n\\nEligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.\\n\\nIn respect of Indian subsidiaries, eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan. Both the eligible employee and the respective companies make monthly contributions to this provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. Amounts collected under the provident fund plan are deposited in a government administered provident fund. The Companies have no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly contributions.\\n\\n# Superannuation\\n\\nCertain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no further obligations to the plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.\\n\\n# Compensated absences\\n\\nThe Group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid/availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.\\n\\n31\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\\n\\nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\n\\nAs a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.\\n\\nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\\n\\nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\\n\\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\\n\\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\\n\\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\\n\\nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

McCamish initiated its incident response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident and remediation and restoration of impacted applications and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the affected applications and systems.\\n\\nLoss of contracted revenues and costs incurred with respect to remediations, restoration, communication efforts, investigative processes and analysis, legal services and others amounted to $38 million (approximately ₹316 crore).\\n\\nActions taken by McCamish included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether and the extent to which company or customer data was subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration. McCamish also engaged a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent and nature of such data. McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery vendor has identified corporate customers and individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration. McCamish’s review process is ongoing. McCamish may incur additional costs including indemnities or damages/claims, which are indeterminable at this time.\\n\\nOn March 6, 2024, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against McCamish. The complaint arises out of the cybersecurity incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023. The complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of all individuals within the United States whose personally identifiable information was exposed to unauthorized third parties as a result of the incident.\\n\\n# 2.21.3 Legal Proceedings\\n\\nApart from this, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.

The Group\\'s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group\\'s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\\n\\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.\\n\\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \\'all other segments\\' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group\\'s offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as \"unallocated\" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.\\n\\nAssets and liabilities used in the Group\\'s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.\\n\\nBusiness segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.\\n\\nDisclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in note 2.16 Revenue from operations.\\n\\n# Business Segments\\n\\n# Three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023:\\n\\n| |Financial Services (1)*|Retail (2)|Communication (3)|Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services|Manufacturing|Hi-Tech|Life Sciences (4)|All other segments (5)|Total| |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue from operations| |10,010|5,429|4,666|5,068|5,589|3,316|2,762|1,083|37,923|\\n| | |10,818|5,537|4,411|4,825|5,078|2,989|2,681|1,102|37,441|\\n|Identifiable operating expenses| |6,042|2,591|3,033|2,717|3,656|1,995|1,639|652|22,325|\\n| | |6,161|2,869|2,613|2,614|3,248|1,734|1,514|701|21,454|\\n|Allocated expenses| |2,027|974|823|920|852|518|491|209|6,814|\\n| | |2,057|1,034|840|909|928|505|462|254|6,989|\\n|Segment operating income| |1,941|1,864|810|1,431|1,081|803|632|222|8,784|\\n| | |2,600|1,634|958|1,302|902|750|705|147|8,998|\\n|Unallocable expenses| | | | | | | |1,163| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |1,121| | |\\n|Other income, net (Refer to Note 2.17)| | | | | | | |2,729| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |671| | |\\n|Finance cost| | | | | | | |110| | |\\n| | | | |82| | | | | | |\\n|Profit before tax| | | | | | | |10,240| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |8,466| | |\\n|Income tax expense| | | | | | | |2,265| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |2,332| | |\\n|Net Profit| | | | | | | |7,975| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |6,134| | |\\n|Depreciation and amortization| | | | | | | |1,163| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |1,121| | |\\n|Non-cash expenses other than depreciation and amortization| | | | | | | |—| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |—| | |', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

              " b'# OA81XOA91X2.23 SEGMENT REPORTING\\n\\nInd AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group\\'s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group\\'s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\\n\\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.\\n\\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \\'all other segments\\' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group\\'s offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as \"unallocated\" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.\\n\\nAssets and liabilities used in the Group\\'s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.\\n\\nBusiness segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.\\n\\nDisclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in note 2.16 Revenue from operations.\\n\\n# Business Segments\\n\\n# Three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023:\\n\\n| |Financial Services (1)*|Retail (2)|Communication (3)|Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services|Manufacturing|Hi-Tech|Life Sciences (4)|All other segments (5)|Total| |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue from operations| |10,010|5,429|4,666|5,068|5,589|3,316|2,762|1,083|37,923|\\n| | |10,818|5,537|4,411|4,825|5,078|2,989|2,681|1,102|37,441|\\n|Identifiable operating expenses| |6,042|2,591|3,033|2,717|3,656|1,995|1,639|652|22,325|\\n| | |6,161|2,869|2,613|2,614|3,248|1,734|1,514|701|21,454|\\n|Allocated expenses| |2,027|974|823|920|852|518|491|209|6,814|\\n| | |2,057|1,034|840|909|928|505|462|254|6,989|\\n|Segment operating income| |1,941|1,864|810|1,431|1,081|803|632|222|8,784|\\n| | |2,600|1,634|958|1,302|902|750|705|147|8,998|\\n|Unallocable expenses| | | | | | | |1,163| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |1,121| | |\\n|Other income, net (Refer to Note 2.17)| | | | | | | |2,729| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |671| | |\\n|Finance cost| | | | | | | |110| | |\\n| | | | |82| | | | | | |\\n|Profit before tax| | | | | | | |10,240| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |8,466| | |\\n|Income tax expense| | | | | | | |2,265| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |2,332| | |\\n|Net Profit| | | | | | | |7,975| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |6,134| | |\\n|Depreciation and amortization| | | | | | | |1,163| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |1,121| | |\\n|Non-cash expenses other than depreciation and amortization| | | | | | | |\\xe2\\x80\\x94| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |\\xe2\\x80\\x94| | |',\n",
              " b'# 2.2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\n# Accounting policy\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\\n\\n|Buildings (1)|22-25 years|\\n|---|---|\\n|Plant and machinery (1)(2)|5 years|\\n|Office equipment|5 years|\\n|Computer equipment (1)|3-5 years|\\n|Furniture and fixtures (1)|5 years|\\n|Vehicles(1)|5 years|\\n|Leasehold improvements|Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term|\\n\\n(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.\\n\\n(2) Includes Solar plant with a useful life of 25 years.\\n\\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.\\n\\nAdvances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under \\xe2\\x80\\x98Capital work-in-progress\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.\\n\\n# Impairment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\\n\\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\\n\\n# The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:\\n\\n|Particulars|Land - Freehold|Buildings (1)|Plant and machinery|Office Equipment|Computer equipment|Furniture and fixtures|Leasehold Improvements|Vehicles|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Gross carrying value as at January 1, 2024|1,432|11,498|3,305|1,510|8,497|2,308|1,456|45|30,051|\\n|Additions|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|287|140|33|345|54|35|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|894|\\n|Deletions**|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(16)|(14)|(224)|(34)|(37)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(325)|\\n|Translation difference|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(15)|(1)|(1)|(7)|(2)|(7)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(33)|\\n|Gross carrying value as at March 31, 2024|1,432|11,770|3,428|1,528|8,611|2,326|1,447|45|30,587|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at January 1, 2024|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(4,814)|(2,584)|(1,253)|(6,267)|(1,807)|(1,131)|(42)|(17,898)|\\n|Depreciation|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(111)|(63)|(32)|(336)|(58)|(46)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(646)|\\n|Accumulated depreciation on deletions**|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|16|14|219|26|34|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|309|\\n|Translation difference|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|4|1|2|4|2|5|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|18|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at March 31, 2024|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(4,921)|(2,630)|(1,269)|(6,380)|(1,837)|(1,138)|(42)|(18,217)|\\n|Carrying value as at January 1, 2024|1,432|6,684|721|257|2,230|501|325|3|12,153|\\n|Carrying value as at March 31, 2024|1,432|6,849|798|259|2,231|489|309|3|12,370|\\n\\n# The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were as follows:\\n\\n|Particulars|Land - Freehold|Buildings (1)|Plant and machinery|Office Equipment|Computer equipment|Furniture and fixtures|Leasehold Improvements|Vehicles|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Gross carrying value as at January 1, 2023|1,431|11,530|3,368|1,466|8,895|2,450|1,353|44|30,537|\\n|Additions|2|29|109|55|494|162|103|1|955|\\n|Deletions*|(2)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(175)|(40)|(877)|(311)|(13)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(1,418)|\\n|Translation difference|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|3|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|1|7|2|2|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|15|\\n|Gross carrying value as at March 31, 2023|1,431|11,562|3,302|1,482|8,519|2,303|1,445|45|30,089|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at January 1, 2023|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(4,425)|(2,547)|(1,206)|(6,339)|(1,922)|(992)|(39)|(17,470)|\\n|Depreciation|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(109)|(65)|(31)|(354)|(62)|(48)|(1)|(670)|\\n|Accumulated depreciation on deletions*|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|175|40|871|310|9|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|1,405|\\n|Translation difference|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(1)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(1)|(4)|(1)|(1)|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(8)|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at March 31, 2023|\\xe2\\x80\\x94|(4,535)|(2,437)|(1,198)|(5,826)|(1,675)|(1,032)|(40)|(16,743)|\\n|Carrying value as at January 1, 2023|1,431|7,105|821|260|2,556|528|361|5|13,067|\\n|Carrying value as at March 31, 2023|1,431|7,027|865|284|2,693|628|413|5|13,346|',\n",

The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\\n\\nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cROU\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\n\\nAs a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.\\n\\nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\\n\\nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\\n\\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\\n\\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\\n\\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\\n\\nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.']"

Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.\\n\\nInvoicing to the clients for other fixed price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.\\n\\nInvoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.\\n\\nTrade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.',\n",
              " b'# OA81XOA91X2.23 SEGMENT REPORTING\\n\\nInd AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group\\'s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group\\'s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\\n\\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.\\n\\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \\'all other segments\\' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group\\'s offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably.

Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.\\n\\nThe Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\n# Revenue from operation for the three months and year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows:\\n\\n|Particulars|Three months ended March 31, 2024|Three months ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2024|Year ended March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue from software services|36,064|35,199|145,285|137,575|\\n|Revenue from products and platforms|1,859|2,242|8,385|9,192|\\n|Total revenue from operations|37,923|37,441|153,670|146,767|\\n\\n# Products & platforms\\n\\nThe Group also derives revenues from the sale of products and platforms including Finacle – core banking solution, Edge Suite of products, Panaya platform, Infosys Equinox, Infosys Helix, Infosys Applied AI, Infosys Cortex, Stater digital platform and Infosys McCamish – insurance platform.\\n\\n# Disaggregated revenue information\\n\\nRevenue disaggregation by business segments has been included in segment information (Refer to Note 2.23).

Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.\\n\\nThe Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.\\n\\nInvoicing to the clients for other fixed price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.\\n\\nInvoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.\\n\\nTrade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.',\n",

The Group\\'s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group\\'s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\\n\\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.\\n\\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \\'all other segments\\' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group\\'s offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably.

The Group\\'s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group\\'s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\\n\\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.\\n\\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \\'all other segments\\' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group\\'s offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as \"unallocated\" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.\\n\\nAssets and liabilities used in the Group\\'s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.\\n\\nBusiness segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.\\n\\nDisclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in note 2.16 Revenue from operations.\\n\\n# Business Segments\\n\\n# Three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023:\\n\\n| |Financial Services (1)*|Retail (2)|Communication (3)|Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services|Manufacturing|Hi-Tech|Life Sciences (4)|All other segments (5)|Total| |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue from operations| |10,010|5,429|4,666|5,068|5,589|3,316|2,762|1,083|37,923|\\n| | |10,818|5,537|4,411|4,825|5,078|2,989|2,681|1,102|37,441|\\n|Identifiable operating expenses| |6,042|2,591|3,033|2,717|3,656|1,995|1,639|652|22,325|\\n| | |6,161|2,869|2,613|2,614|3,248|1,734|1,514|701|21,454|\\n|Allocated expenses| |2,027|974|823|920|852|518|491|209|6,814|\\n| | |2,057|1,034|840|909|928|505|462|254|6,989|\\n|Segment operating income| |1,941|1,864|810|1,431|1,081|803|632|222|8,784|\\n| | |2,600|1,634|958|1,302|902|750|705|147|8,998|\\n|Unallocable expenses| | | | | | | |1,163| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |1,121| | |\\n|Other income, net (Refer to Note 2.17)| | | | | | | |2,729| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |671| | |\\n|Finance cost| | | | | | | |110| | |\\n| | | | |82| | | | | | |\\n|Profit before tax| | | | | | | |10,240| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |8,466| | |\\n|Income tax expense| | | | | | | |2,265| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |2,332| | |\\n|Net Profit| | | | | | | |7,975| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |6,134| | |\\n|Depreciation and amortization| | | | | | | |1,163| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |1,121| | |\\n|Non-cash expenses other than depreciation and amortization| | | | | | | |—| | |\\n| | | | | | | | |—| | |',\n",
              "   '# 2.2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\n# Accounting policy\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\\n\\n|Buildings (1)|22-25 years|\\n|---|---|\\n|Plant and machinery (1)(2)|5 years|\\n|Office equipment|5 years|\\n|Computer equipment (1)|3-5 years|\\n|Furniture and fixtures (1)|5 years|\\n|Vehicles(1)|5 years|\\n|Leasehold improvements|Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term|\\n\\n(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.\\n\\n(2) Includes Solar plant with a useful life of 25 years.\\n\\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.\\n\\nAdvances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.\\n\\n# Impairment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\\n\\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\\n\\n# The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:\\n\\n|Particulars|Land - Freehold|Buildings (1)|Plant and machinery|Office Equipment|Computer equipment|Furniture and fixtures|Leasehold Improvements|Vehicles|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Gross carrying value as at January 1, 2024|1,432|11,498|3,305|1,510|8,497|2,308|1,456|45|30,051|\\n|Additions|—|287|140|33|345|54|35|—|894|\\n|Deletions**|—|—|(16)|(14)|(224)|(34)|(37)|—|(325)|\\n|Translation difference|—|(15)|(1)|(1)|(7)|(2)|(7)|—|(33)|\\n|Gross carrying value as at March 31, 2024|1,432|11,770|3,428|1,528|8,611|2,326|1,447|45|30,587|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at January 1, 2024|—|(4,814)|(2,584)|(1,253)|(6,267)|(1,807)|(1,131)|(42)|(17,898)|\\n|Depreciation|—|(111)|(63)|(32)|(336)|(58)|(46)|—|(646)|\\n|Accumulated depreciation on deletions**|—|—|16|14|219|26|34|—|309|\\n|Translation difference|—|4|1|2|4|2|5|—|18|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at March 31, 2024|—|(4,921)|(2,630)|(1,269)|(6,380)|(1,837)|(1,138)|(42)|(18,217)|\\n|Carrying value as at January 1, 2024|1,432|6,684|721|257|2,230|501|325|3|12,153|\\n|Carrying value as at March 31, 2024|1,432|6,849|798|259|2,231|489|309|3|12,370|\\n\\n# The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were as follows:\\n\\n|Particulars|Land - Freehold|Buildings (1)|Plant and machinery|Office Equipment|Computer equipment|Furniture and fixtures|Leasehold Improvements|Vehicles|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Gross carrying value as at January 1, 2023|1,431|11,530|3,368|1,466|8,895|2,450|1,353|44|30,537|\\n|Additions|2|29|109|55|494|162|103|1|955|\\n|Deletions*|(2)|—|(175)|(40)|(877)|(311)|(13)|—|(1,418)|\\n|Translation difference|—|3|—|1|7|2|2|—|15|\\n|Gross carrying value as at March 31, 2023|1,431|11,562|3,302|1,482|8,519|2,303|1,445|45|30,089|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at January 1, 2023|—|(4,425)|(2,547)|(1,206)|(6,339)|(1,922)|(992)|(39)|(17,470)|\\n|Depreciation|—|(109)|(65)|(31)|(354)|(62)|(48)|(1)|(670)|\\n|Accumulated depreciation on deletions*|—|—|175|40|871|310|9|—|1,405|\\n|Translation difference|—|(1)|—|(1)|(4)|(1)|(1)|—|(8)|\\n|Accumulated depreciation as at March 31, 2023|—|(4,535)|(2,437)|(1,198)|(5,826)|(1,675)|(1,032)|(40)|(16,743)|\\n|Carrying value as at January 1, 2023|1,431|7,105|821|260|2,556|528|361|5|13,067|\\n|Carrying value as at March 31, 2023|1,431|7,027|865|284|2,693|628|413|5|13,346|',\n",

The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\\n\\nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\n\\nAs a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.\\n\\nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\\n\\nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\\n\\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\\n\\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\\n\\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\\n\\nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.']},\n",
